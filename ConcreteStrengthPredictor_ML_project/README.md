## Concrete strength predictor

This project predicts the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning. It uses ingredient data such as cement, water, aggregates, and age to train regression models. The goal is to estimate concrete strength accurately and reduce dependency on manual laboratory testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about concrete mix ingredients and their effect on compressive strength. It includes the following features:

# 1.Cement

# 2.Blast Furnace Slag

# 3.Fly Ash

# 4.Water

# 5.Superplasticizer

# 6.Coarse Aggregate

# 7.Fine Aggregate

# 8.Age (in days)

## Target Variable:

# 1.Concrete Compressive Strength (MPa)
